# BattleRoster

BattleRoster is designed to streamline tabletop game management for both players and dungeon masters. Players can easily create, edit, and organize their character sheets, while dungeon masters can oversee groups, manage player sheets, and coordinate campaigns.
Built with extensibility in mind, the system supports modular character sheet templates, making it adaptable for multiple game systems such as Dungeons & Dragons or BattleTech. The site emphasizes usability with responsive design, lightweight interactivity through HTMX, and secure role-based permissions to protect player data. Future plans include chat integration, dice rolling tools, campaign notes, and export options, making it a comprehensive digital companion for tabletop gaming communities.
